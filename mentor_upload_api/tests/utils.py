    """
    Useful for mocking class instances.

    In python, you cannot access dictionary keys with .[prop] notation,
    e.g. you can access a property like this `mydict['myprop']`
    but not like this `mydict.prop`

    So when you want to mock an object that has properties,
    you can't just use a dictionary. You *can* instead
    just use Bunches like this:

    ```
    myObj = Bunch(
        myProp = Bunch(myNestedProp = 'a')
    )

    print(myObj.myProp.myNestedProp) # prints 'a'
    ```
    """

    def return_clients(client_type, **kwargs):
        return mock_s3_client if client_type == "s3" else None

    mock_boto3_client.side_effect = return_clients
    return mock_s3_client
